            <h4 style="color: #222;" class="i">Traditional office interior design often emphasizes a classic, timeless
                aesthetic that combines elegance
                and functionality. The color palette usually includes rich, warm tones like deep greens, burgundies, and
                browns, often complemented by
                neutral shades. Furniture is typically made of high-quality woods, featuring ornate details and classic
                shapes, such as mahogany desks and
                leather-upholstered chairs. Lighting plays a crucial role, with a preference for warm, ambient sources
                like chandeliers or table lamps with soft,
                shaded light. Traditional offices often incorporate decorative elements such as framed artwork,
                bookshelves filled with books, and ornate rugs,
                contributing to a sophisticated atmosphere. </h4>

            <h4 style="color: #222;" class="i">Modern office interior design focuses on creating open, flexible spaces
                that encourage collaboration and creativity.
                The aesthetic often features clean lines, minimalism, and a neutral color palette, with pops of color
                used to energize the environment. Furniture tends
                to be functional yet stylish, utilizing materials like metal, glass, and sustainable wood. Open floor
                plans are common, promoting interaction among team
                members, while designated areas for quiet work or brainstorming sessions are incorporated to accommodate
                various working styles. Natural light is emphasized,
                with large windows and glass partitions to enhance transparency and connectivity. </h4>
